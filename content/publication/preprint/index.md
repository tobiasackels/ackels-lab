title: Fast odour dynamics are encoded in the olfactory system and guide behaviour
abstract: Odours are transported in turbulent plumes, which result in rapid
  concentration fluctuations1,2 that contain rich information about the
  olfactory scenery, such as the composition and location of an odour
  source2,3,4. However, it is unclear whether the mammalian olfactory system can
  use the underlying temporal structure to extract information about the
  environment. Here we show that ten-millisecond odour pulse patterns produce
  distinct responses in olfactory receptor neurons. In operant conditioning
  experiments, mice discriminated temporal correlations of rapidly fluctuating
  odours at frequencies of up to 40 Hz. In imaging and electrophysiological
  recordings, such correlation information could be readily extracted from the
  activity of mitral and tufted cells—the output neurons of the olfactory bulb.
  Furthermore, temporal correlation of odour concentrations5 reliably predicted
  whether odorants emerged from the same or different sources in naturalistic
  environments with complex airflow. Experiments in which mice were trained on
  such tasks and probed using synthetic correlated stimuli at different
  frequencies suggest that mice can use the temporal structure of odours to
  extract information about space. Thus, the mammalian olfactory system has
  access to unexpectedly fast temporal features in odour stimuli. This endows
  animals with the capacity to overcome key behavioural challenges such as odour
  source separation5, figure–ground segregation6 and odour localization7 by
  extracting information about space from temporal odour dynamics.
