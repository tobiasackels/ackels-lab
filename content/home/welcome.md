Welcome to the website of the Ackels lab. The goal of the lab will be to answer questions on how mammals use their senses to make behavioral decisions. More information on our research and on how to contact us if you are interested in joining us will be coming soon!

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Sensory input across modalities is highly dynamic, continuously confronting the brain with the task of making sense of the external world. Olfaction is a key sense that many species depend on for survival, for example to locate food sources and mating partners or to avoid encountering predators. In the absence of visual cues, olfactory cues are especially useful, as they provide information over a large range of distances. 
<p>
Natural odours form temporally complex plumes that show rapid fluctuations in odour concentration. These temporal dynamics of odours carry spatial information about an odour landscape. This can be of vital importance when navigating an environment, in particular for nocturnal animals such as mice or rats. In a recent paradigm-shift the sense of smell is increasingly acknowledged to be a high-bandwidth modality.  
</p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
Understanding on the cellular, circuit and behavioural level how this spatial information is used by mammals to navigate their environment constitutes one of the primary research question of the lab.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
To deliver odor stimuli in a controlled and temporally precise manner, we developed a high-speed odor delivery device ("tODD"). Temporally complex odor plumes of different chemical identity, concentration and across a range of temporal profiles are presented to animals. Mice are either placed on a disk-shaped treadmill or they are freely moving in a behavioral arena and need to, for example, navigate to the source of an odor stimulus.  
We record the animal's respiration profile to present odour stimuli precisely during a particular time of the respiration cycle, typically triggered to the start inhalation.

We use dual-color 2-Photon Ca2+ imaging and extracellular probes to record neuronal activity from populations of neurons in different parts of the olfactory system. To understand the processing of temporally complex odor stimuli, we use machine learning-based data analysis and computational modelling methods.

Perturbing and manipulating neuronal activity using opto- and chemogenetic techniques will allow us to understand the mechanisms underlying processing of temporally complex odors on the neuronal and behavioral level.
