<!-- Introduction section -->
<div style="text-align:center"> Welcome to the website of the Ackels lab. Our overarching goal is to answer questions on:  
<br><em>How are the dynamics of the external world encoded and how do they inform behavior?</em>
<p>

We are a newly formed lab and are currently hiring at all levels!  
See our [open positions](/positions) and [get in touch](/contact) if you are interested in joining us! </div>

<div style="text-align:justify">
Sensory input across modalities is highly dynamic, continuously confronting the brain with the task of making sense of the external world. Olfaction is a key sense that many species depend on for survival, for example to locate food sources and mating partners or to avoid encountering predators. In the absence of visual cues, olfactory cues are especially useful, as they provide information over a large range of distances.  
<p>

Natural odors form temporally complex plumes that show rapid fluctuations in odor concentration. These temporal dynamics carry spatial information about the odor landscape. This can be of vital importance when navigating an environment, in particular for nocturnal animals such as mice or rats. In a recent paradigm-shift the sense of smell is increasingly acknowledged to be a high-bandwidth modality that has access to the complex temporal structure of natural odor plumes.

<div style="text-align:justify">
Understanding how this spatial information is used by mammals to navigate their environment on the cellular, circuit and behavioral level constitutes one of the primary research questions of the lab.

Tobias was born in Germany and is currently a senior postdoctoral researcher at the Francis Crick Institute in London. He received his Diploma in Biology from RWTH Aachen University, where he also completed his PhD studies in 2015 in the Department of Chemosensation. His doctoral research mainly focused on signalling mechanisms in the olfactory system. Supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from the DFG, he moved to the laboratory of Prof. Andreas Schaefer at the Francis Crick Institute, where his interest lies in the investigation of how natural sensory stimuli are perceived and processed in the mammalian brain on the cellular and network level using physiological and behavioral techniques.  </font>

Tobias was awarded an ERC Starting Grant for his project “TempCOdE: Temporally complex odor information encoding” in 2022 and has now started to set up his laboratory as a group leader at the Institute for Experimental Epileptology and Cognition Research (IEECR) as part of the Medical Faculty at the University of Bonn.  </font>
