## Sensory neuroscience of behaviour lab
Welcome to the website of the Ackels lab. The goal of the lab is to answer questions on how mammals use their senses to make behavioral decisions.  
Please get in touch if you are interested in joining us!  


### How do mammals extract information about space from time?


## Key methods and techniques
To deliver odor stimuli in a controlled and temporally precise manner, we developed a high-speed odor delivery device ("tODD"). Temporally complex odor plumes of different chemical identity, concentration and across a range of temporal profiles are presented to animals. Mice are either placed on a disk-shaped treadmill or they are freely moving in a behavioral arena and need to, for example, navigate to the source of an odor stimulus.  
We record the animal's respiration profile to present odour stimuli precisely during a particular time of the respiration cycle, typically triggered to the start inhalation.  

We use dual-color 2-Photon Ca2+ imaging and extracellular probes to record neuronal activity from populations of neurons in different parts of the olfactory system. To understand the processing of temporally complex odor stimuli, we use machine learning-based data analysis and computational modelling methods.  

Perturbing and manipulating neuronal activity using opto- and chemogenetic techniques will allow us to understand the mechanisms underlying processing of temporally complex odors on the neuronal and behavioral level.
