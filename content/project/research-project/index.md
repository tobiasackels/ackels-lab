## Representation of complex odours across the mammalian olfactory system

In this project, we plan to examine how temporally complex odor information is represented and transformed within the olfactory bulb (OB) and across its major downstream cortical target regions using in vivo imaging and electrophysiology.

## Cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying complex odour processing in mice

The aim of this project is to gain mechanistic understaning of temporally complex odour processing in the olfactory bulb by perturbing local inhibitory circuitry as well as cortical feedback projections.

## Odour-guided navigation using complex odour information

In this project, we will investigate which temporal features inform odour-guided navigation, an ethologically relevant task, while monitoring the animalâ€™s sampling strategy and recording neural activity in different parts of the olfactory system in freely moving animals.
