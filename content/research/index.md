<font size="5">Representation of complex odours across the mammalian olfactory system</font>

<font size="3">In this project, we plan to examine how temporally complex odor information is represented and transformed within the olfactory bulb (OB) and across its major downstream cortical target regions using *in vivo* imaging and electrophysiology.</font>

<font size="5">Cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying complex odour processing in mice</font>

<font size="3">The aim of this project is to gain mechanistic understaning of temporally complex odor processing in the olfactory bulb by perturbing local inhibitory circuitry as well as cortical feedback projections.</font>

<font size="5">Olfactory navigation using complex odor information</font>

<font size="3">The goal of this project is to investigate which temporal features inform odor-guided navigation, an ethologically relevant task, while monitoring the animalâ€™s sampling strategy and recording neural activity in different parts of the olfactory system in freely moving animals.</font>

<font size="3"><strong>Odor delivery</strong><p>  
To present odor stimuli in a controlled and temporally precise manner, we developed a high-speed odor delivery device ("tODD", Ackels <em>et al.</em>, 2021). Temporally complex odor plumes of different chemical identity, concentration and across a range of temporal profiles are presented to animals. Mice are either placed on a treadmill in a head-fixed condition or they are freely moving in a behavioral arena and need to, for example, navigate to the source of an odor.  
We record the animal's respiration profile to present odor stimuli precisely during a particular time of the respiration cycle, typically triggered to the start inhalation.</font>

<font size="3"><strong>Recording neural activity</strong><p>
We use dual-color 2-Photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and extracellular probes to record neuronal activity from populations of neurons in different parts of the olfactory system. To understand how temporally complex odor stimuli are respresented and processed, we analyse neural activity on a single cell and population level, and use machine learning-based data analysis together with computational modelling methods.</font>

<font size="3"><strong>Circuit interrogation</strong><p>
The mechanisms underlying processing of temporally complex odors both on the neuronal and behavioral level remain unknown. To investigate this, we perturb and manipulate neuronal activity using opto- and chemogenetic techniques. Employing viral vectors in combination with transgenic mouse lines allows us to target specific cell populations during physiology and behavioral experiments.</font>

<font size="3"><strong>Animal behavior</strong><p>
In an olfactory-guided navigation task, we investigate which features of complex, naturalistic olfactory cues are informative when tracking an odor to its source. In a behavioral arena, animal movement is tracked at high spatial and temporal resolution. In addition, we visualise what the animal smells, record its respiratory sampling strategy and neural activity during the odor localisation task. This approach allows to directly link specific odour events that the animal encounters with navigation parameters such as body speed and head direction, the respiratory sampling strategy, together with neural activity.</font>
