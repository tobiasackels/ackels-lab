<font size="5">Representation of complex odours across the mammalian olfactory system</font>

<font size="3">In this project, we plan to examine how temporally complex odor information is represented and transformed within the olfactory bulb (OB) and across its major downstream cortical target regions using *in vivo* imaging and electrophysiology.</font>

<font size="5">Cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying complex odour processing in mice</font>

<font size="3">The aim of this project is to gain a mechanistic understanding of temporally complex odor processing in the olfactory bulb by perturbing the local inhibitory circuitry as well as cortical feedback projections.</font>

<font size="5">Olfactory navigation using complex odor information</font>

<font size="3">Tracking an odor to its source can be of vital importance in the search for food, potential mating partners or to avoid encounters with a predator. The goal of this project is to investigate how temporal features of odor plumes inform odor-guided navigation.</font>

<font size="3"><strong>Odor delivery</strong><p>  
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
To present odor stimuli in a controlled and temporally precise manner, we developed a high-speed odor delivery device ("tODD", Ackels <em>et al.</em>, 2021). Temporally complex odor plumes of different chemical identity, concentration and across a range of temporal profiles are presented to animals. Mice are, for example, head-fixed on a treadmill where we record the animal's respiration profile to present odor stimuli precisely during a particular time of the respiration cycle, typically triggered to the start inhalation.</font>

<font size="3"><strong>Recording neural activity</strong><p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
We use dual-color 2-Photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and extracellular probes to record neuronal activity from populations of neurons in different parts of the olfactory system. To understand how temporally complex odor stimuli are respresented and processed, we analyse neural activity on a single cell and population level, and use machine learning-based data analysis together with computational modelling methods.</font>

<font size="3"><strong>Circuit interrogation</strong><p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
The neuronal mechanisms underlying processing of temporally complex odors remain unknown. To investigate this, we perturb and manipulate neuronal activity using opto- and chemogenetic techniques. Employing viral vectors in combination with transgenic mouse lines allows us to target specific cell populations during physiology and behavioral experiments.</font>

<font size="3"><strong>Animal behavior</strong><p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
In an olfactory-guided navigation task, we investigate which features of complex, naturalistic olfactory cues are informative to animals tracking an odor to its source. In a behavioral arena, animal movement is tracked along with the odor profile that it encounters. In addition, we monitor the animalâ€™s respiration strategy and record neural activity in different olfactory brain regions.</font>
