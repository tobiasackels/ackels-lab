Tobias was born in Germany and is currently a senior postdoctoral researcher at the Francis Crick Institute in London. He received his Diploma in Biology from RWTH Aachen University, where he also completed his PhD studies in 2015 in the Department of Chemosensation. His doctoral research mainly focused on signalling mechanisms in the olfactory system. Supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from the DFG, he moved to the laboratory of Prof. Andreas Schaefer at the Francis Crick Institute, where his interest lies in the investigation of how natural sensory stimuli are perceived and processed in the mammalian brain on the cellular and network level using physiological and behavioural techniques. 
Tobias was awarded an ERC Starting Grant for his project “TempCOdE: Temporally complex odour information encoding” in 2022 and is now setting up his own laboratory.
