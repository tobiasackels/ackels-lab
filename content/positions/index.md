Are you curious about how the brain extracts relevant bits from the constant flow of sensory information we are under? 
We are a small, new lab located in the midst of the exceptional scientific community in beautiful Bonn.  

There are several benefits of joining our newly founded lab such as:
*  You will be working as part of a small team of highly motivated and enthusiastic people in a highly collaborative environment  
*  You will have more 1-on-1 time with the PI  
*  You will have privileged access to a wide array of cutting-edge technologies  
(multi-photon imaging, electrophysiology, optogenetics, behavior etc.)
*  You will have the opportunity to develop your own research project  
*  There will be more resources per person  
*  You will see how an early-stage lab is run which will help with your own future career  


We are actively looking for PhD students, a Postdoc and a Technical Assistant to join the team. All positions are fully funded and supported by our third party funds, including the ERC.
