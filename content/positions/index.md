Are you curious about how the brain extracts relevant bits from the constant flow of sensory information we are under? We are actively looking for PhD students, a Postdoc and a Technical Assistant to join the team. All positions are fully funded and supported by our third party funds, including the ERC.  
<br>

### GRADUATE STUDENTS
PhD projects are available to motivated candidates to help us investigate how temporally complex odors are represented and processed in the brain and how mice use dynamic odor plumes to navigate their environment. For more details, please see the job adverts:  

*  PhD project Physiology: <a href="/uploads/jobs/PhD_advert_physiology_Ackels_.pdf" target="_blank">Representation and processing of temporally complex odors</a>  
*  PhD project Behavior:   <a href="/uploads/jobs/PhD_advert_behavior_Ackels_.pdf" target="_blank">Olfactory navigation using dynamic odor plumes</a>  

<br>

### POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER
We are recruiting a postdoctoral researcher to drive a project at the frontier of sensory neuroscience and behavior in our lab. For more details, please see the job advert:

### TECHNICAL ASSISTANT
We are currently looking for a laboratory technician to help with ordering and setting up equipment, colony maintenance, bench work, and running neurophysiological and behavioral experiments.
More information can be found in the job advert.
